# Fython Transpiler

Fython Transpiler is a simple tool that allows you to write Python code using the fun keyword instead of the def keyword. The transpiler will convert your fun-based code to standard Python code that uses def, so that you can still run your code using a standard Python interpreter.
Usage

    - Create a new Python file using the .fpy extension (e.g. example.fpy).

    - Write your Python code using the fun keyword instead of def (e.g. fun my_function(): instead of def my_function():).

    - Save your .fpy file in the same directory as the fython executable.

    - Open a command prompt or terminal window and navigate to the directory containing your .fpy file and the fython executable.

    - Run the following command to transpile your .fpy file:

    ./fython example.fpy

    This will create a new Python file in the same directory with the same name as your original file, but with the .py extension (e.g. example.py).

    You can now run your Python code as usual using a standard Python interpreter.

# Why use Fython Transpiler?

While the use of the def keyword in Python may seem odd or unappealing to some people, it has become a standard part of the language syntax over the years. However, with Fython Transpiler, you can now write your Python code using the fun keyword instead of def, and then easily convert it to standard Python syntax using the transpiler. This can help you avoid using the def keyword altogether while still being able to write valid Python code.
